Ingredients:
 - 2 chickens
 - 1 quart buttermilk
 - 1 tablespoon kosher salt
 - 1 tablespoon freshly ground black better


Directions:
  1. Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour the buttermilk over them.Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
  2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  3. Combine the flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
  4. Take the chicken out of the buttermilk and coat each piece thoroughly with the flour mixture.
  5. Pour the oil into a large heavy-bottomed stockpot to a depth of 1-inch and heat to 360 degrees F on a thermometer.
  6. Working in batches, carefully place several pieces of chicken in the oil and fry for about 3 minutes on each side until the coating is a light golden brown (it will continue to brown in the oven).
  7. Remove the chicken from the oil and place each piece on a metal baking rack set on a sheet pan. Allow the oil to return to 360 degrees F before frying the next batch.
  8. When all the chicken is fried, bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is no longer pink inside. Serve hot.
